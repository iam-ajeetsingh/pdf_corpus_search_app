Model Report:
Global Displacement Monitoring
1.Background
This document summarizes the documentation and findings of the peer review of the global
displacement monitoring model that has been developed by the UN OCHA Centre for
Humanitarian Data. This model creates a simple flagging systemthatusesglobaldatasources
to raise an alert when a potential shock or humanitarian consequence may have occurred that
could require global attention. For this review, the focus is on a model flagging displacement
data, where alerts are generated based on abnormal levels of displacement seen within a
countryorstaticthresholdsbeingmet,withdifferenttimepoints.

2.MainFindingsandRecommendations
You can find all the documentation regarding the model, its application and the reviewprocess
atthefollowinglinks:
● The Model Card describes version 1.0 of the model and was completed in February
2023.
● The Model Evaluation Matrix was completed in February 2023 by an expert on
displacementdata.
● The Implementation Plan was completed in March 2023.It summarizes how the model
output is used to alert the UN Central Emergency Response Fund team about a
deterioratingsituation.
● The Ethical Matrix aims to identify all stakeholders and potential issues regarding the
intended use of the model. The Ethical Matrix was completed in May 2023 by Fanny

2.1TechnicalReview
ModelDevelopmentandDocumentation
There are no major issues that would seriously impact the validity of the model. The main
recommendation is to ensure that dynamic displacementsituationsarecorrectlyflaggedbythe
model. Also, in addition to percentile-based thresholds, additional warning thresholdsbasedon
theabsolutenumberofpeopledisplacedcouldbeaddedtothemodel.
ModelEvaluation
It should be clarified in the documentation that the alert system has been designed with a
specific use case in mind and may not be appropriate for other potential use cases. It is
therefore recommended to better articulate the situations in which the model is expected to
havegoodperformancecomparedtothosethatthemodelisexpectedtomiss.

For the end user (CERF) this would be a high priority risk as it would to the team relying on a
modelthatdoesn’tprovidereliableoutputs.
SystematicBias
Systematic bias refers to the datasets used to train the algorithm not reflecting the full
complexityofthereality.
This issue is of high priority as it could potentially lead to ill informed decisions by the CERF
team and eventually a misallocation of resources. It is therefore recommended to always
validate the information from the model with local partners and use alternative tools, - where
